🧩 About Me
I started my journey selling insurance but quickly discovered my passion for data — uncovering insights, building models, and automating processes.
With 5+ years in Finance and Insurance and 3 years as a Data Analyst, I combine analytical thinking with business strategy.
💡 Self-taught in data analytics and machine learning, I specialize in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to turn raw data into actionable insights.
